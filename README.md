# CS50 Week 4: Filter

A personal implementation of image filters for Harvard CS50's Week 4 problem set.

## Overview

This program applies various image processing filters (grayscale, reflection, blur, edges) to 24-bit uncompressed BMP images.

Implemented in C using 2D arrays and file I/O with BMP headers.

## Files

- `filter.c` – main program logic
- `helpers.c` – my implementation of the filters
- `helpers.h` – function declarations

## Disclaimer

Parts of this project (such as helper files and function headers) were provided by the CS50 staff. All logic in `helpers.c` was written by me.

This solution was published after I completed the assignment in full and in accordance with CS50’s academic policy.
